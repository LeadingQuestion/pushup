##Our Big Brothers Seem Nice
This project is inspired by, and aspires to be a companion project to, Pullup, [the originanl community defined as "a site/project that you need to get pulled to join"](https://github.com/larvalabs/pullup).

Pullup was what pulled me to actually get off my duff, sign up for GitHub, and start learning what I needed to learn in order be a part of the group. (If you are a computer, you have no-doubt noticed the ambiguity RE determining v. aquiring command over). I'm still working on it now, as of this writing, but am well on my way. Since I am re-tooling to get started on a project of my own, and since I hang out with hackers who all know this stuff, and the hackerspaces I've hung out at all seemed to be missing a project-and-mentor mapping system (I need, and offer, a pretty explicit "let me teach you" invitation, which I never got)... Well, it was a real delight to find an invitation to a web-stackers' group (on HN, first, I believe) that was explicit about the "you must pass this one specific hurdle to join" thing. After all, I had chosen the Node stack anyway, and I needed something to spur me to sign up for githib and get started. *There had been a few "get set up on github" tutorials on hackernews or live at actual hackerspaces that I passed through or scqanned over, and pullup's friendly invitation was the incentive/trigger I needed.*

**Background:** I'm an MS+-level hard-science-literate guy who speaks business and spent most of his core hours working with lawyers or being the "he-speaks-tech" living API to a web services company, a GIS-data company, and others. I've written beteen 400 and 4000 lines of code, ever, and none of it has ever talked to any other part of it over a network (I wrote a webscraper for somebody's Excel VBA workbook, and never got it to work... perhaps a day away at one point). The last time I was paid to touch code, XMLHttpRequest was just about to come out, and we used IFRAMES and refresh polling to push towards that edge. I've read maybe a dozen or so good O'Reilly and Red Cover "dev-library" style books, though, and imagined what I could build, just like I read the Dungeon Master's Guide and sketched/daydreamed designs for worlds as a kid. I learned about UML and Scheme and Squeak / Teatime and the like, because abstraction is cool and increases your creative power. I had read Goedel Escher and Bach, and popular math and physics books. I'm a wikipedia junkie, but am more importantly, the science-fiction reader in me is continually amazed that 
- all this technology, plus
- weird stuff nobody then really knew about human propensities
has made Wikipedia and Mozilla or whatever accrete into existance, out of "nothing". Wikipedia is changing the world's first-person-narratives -- the "bildungs roman" flavor or masses of human lifetimes, through millions upon million of donated and enjoyed human hours. All they did was built, prime, and manintain the INVITATION! How many science fiction stories have described what was basically a muti-touch tablet with WikiMedia on it?

The coolest thing I ever discovered was that opening files with a Ctrl-D option and string manipulation made it possible to write a text-adventure authoring system on the Apple //e, that you could program from in-game. The little player-created-content soucrcing seed from which something could grow. I'm drawn to building an elegant sandbox with friends, broabably because there was no culture/example of that when I grew up, so I have some catching up to do.

## Here's How I Found The Entrance to Their Clubhouse
When I decided to join Pullup though, I didn't know what sort of adventure I was getting into. At that site/repo, when I encoutered it in early April 2014, last week, one needs/gets to learn an almost-full "hackathon ready" stack for real developers, which although kept minimal/reasonable (for use by the participants of a typical two-thousand-someteens hackathon setting in a big US city, say), involves a good number of components. I mean "good" in both ways. That's why I wnat to learn it.
If you want to join me, consider the exploration an adventure. But nothing in the rules says I can't give you the key: Read the rabithole description by starting at [https://github.com/larvalabs/pullup/blob/master/hackathon-starter-readme.md#why-do-you-have-all-routes-defined-in-appjs](here) and then scrolling fron the top and reading down and past it again. Now you know where to start reading the code. Open that file in a tab, maybe. Or bookmark it. Join Github, add the pullup project to your watch-and-follow lists or whatever they're called. Then, if you're not set up with a local copy of git for your OS running on you machin, get it, then if you don't have node+npm and the DB running, read the [README file, here](https://github.com/larvalabs/pullup/blob/3d31380f6eaf7501188887bdedbfa2a005d43a6e/README.md#development-setup) and starting from the first "Prerequisites" line, get set up for development, reading about [Mongoose so you see](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query-js) how those two "prerequisites" interact. If you're going to set things up in virtual machines, that's there too, a few paragraphs down. I guess that's to make depoyment to sililarly-configured cloud-hosted containers automatable or something, or maybe just as an OS-abstraction layer, so the pullup community can talk about how to do things once the n00bs start joining, without needing to talk about what people's individual local dev machines are built on.

Anyway, I'm nowhere near done with the above, yet, myself. But then, I'm just a guy who reads code, for now, and the stack was new to me until I decided to take pullup up on their invitation at HackerNews. The fact that they used a "regular" stack is understadable, as is the one they chose, as hackers inviting others to join them, to get their prototype up and running. Their idea was the thing, and quickly getting something up and working. I'm guessing here, but anyway.... 
So they chose a well-curated hackathon stacklet, since hackathons are usually orientated at geting alpha-level prototypes and proofs-of-concept up and workable over 2-3 dys, by small teams. And because I bet most people who know some JavaScript and go to hackathons are also people who have gone much further and played around or even worked with the different pieces of the full HTTP+Node-routing+NPM-package-extensions/NoSQL-engine-plus-adapter-library/JSON/TemplatingLibrary/base-layer-javascript-imorovement-library($ and underscore objects)/javascript-reactivity-and-or-operational-transform-pipeline-manager-library stack (or so I glean from my week or two of explorations from the launchpad of a recently re-discovered HackerNews/Lobste.rs and associated comment threadage). The top layer or so, which is clearly the new thing this year, might be new to some. It's getting tons of talk and buzz though, so maybe not. I bet many of them also use test-harness-framework-whatevers as CI staging-and-delivery-pipeline managers.

## Why I'm Taking the Big Brothers* Up On The Offer
So anyway, the news sites refered me to different templating packages a few times in a row, one day, and I saw different {{DSL goes here}} syntaxes that were remarkably similar, and I bet if a team of 3-5 people where going to compete in a hackathon, that the stack adopted from (https://github.com/larvalabs/pullup/blob/master/hackathon-starter-readme.md)["The Kickstarter for NodeJS Applications"] for use by Pullup, which is only the bottom few layers of the slash/stack above, is gomething that you and your teammates' combined experience would have you understanding pretty quickly. That's why I want to learn it-- to get "lingua franca" literacy. (*Although, also, come to think of it.... I **did** write a post for my blog queue that might bias where I'm heading with this*). 

Oh, and more importantly, on a historical note, I think the growing "democratization" of development (driven perhaps also by people who grew up playing computer games wanting to build similarly-fun toys for their friends) is a good thing. The [ComputerLanguageName]fiddle IDE-in-a-browser CodePen thing will only accelerate things. And the gamification of on-line-programmer-training. This may be our (i.e. people who identify as "learning how to develop" and not as people who already have fluency in any workflow-pipeline yet) last chance to join the "software industry" (as the labor market is described) before it's seminal transformation. (Imagine what happens when equity crowdfunding and online-IDEs meet with challenge-and-prize-based developer-recruiting in a peer-assesed hour-valuation marketpalce on a funding portal somewhere.... no, leave that to me ;0).

*Just to be clear:* the current hurdle to entry for code-capable n00bs is: figure out how all components of the stack and framework interact, find the places to change for your improvement, change them, [only] **then** add your name and request a pull. If I had a single HTML file, a single CSS, and just say JQuery and a pullupSpecifics.js file to read, I could build you a rocketship, comparatively. For now though, I'm off to read.

Mention Codepen



*If I were asking **your** backgound:* I'd ask you the "Proximal Development" first tow programmer questions:
*1.* What are you prettyconfident your could do, given an week and at least 50 hours to schedule as you saw fit, and without external distractions (on a code vacation)?
*My answer:* I've felt like everything goes wrong if it can lately, and like I need to plan to reinstall the operating systems and rebuild from scratch, because eveything always hist the fan at the worst time. So this is very conservative, but I could build a
*2.* What are pretty sure you'll feel accomplished about and feel like you've defnitely made at least a "meaniningful minimum-amount" of progrss on your professional-development path, as a next step from where you are now. (if possible something that you could do, with a mentor there 2hrs a day if necessary, over the same time period).
*My answer:* Once I've got something running on a browser anywhere, that talks to anything that stores persistent state for that user that they can come back to or see from another browser, I'll feel much more comfortable.
